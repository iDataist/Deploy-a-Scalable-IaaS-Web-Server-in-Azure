# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

## Introduction
In modern deployments, automated deployment and management of cloud infrastructure are crucial for ensuring the high uptimes that customers expect. In this project, I wrote infrastructure as code using Terraform and Packer to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure. First, I created a policy that ensures all indexed resources are tagged. Second, I created and deployed a custom web server image with Packer. Lastly, I used Terraform to write the infrastructure configuration, which uses the custom image to create a set of load-balanced web servers. 

## Getting Started
